# hello-world
first repository
To start it off, i want to use this GitHub to help bridge between Statistics and Data Science. Six months ago I made a decision to pursuit a career in data science.  Not knowing much about data science and Python programming I went down the path.  Six months later I may have found my path.  I am proud to be a statistician.  At the saem time I am passionate about predictive analytics, machine learning, deep leaning. Natural Language Processing applications in health care.

Along the way I find that with my statistical background I can help bridge the gaps between the two sides.  Here I am.  As a fisrt step, I set up my GitHub blog and i hope the rest will be a hitory of my adventure in the two fields.
